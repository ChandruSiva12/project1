Beyond the realm of cricket, this venture served as a future business opportunity for him, as he sought to diversify his portfolio after retirement from the sport.[105] In November 2014, Kohli partnered with Anjana Reddy's Universal Sportsbiz (USPL) to launch the youth fashion brand WROGN. The brand specialized in men's casual wear clothing and entered into collaborations with prominent retail outlets such as Myntra and Shopper's Stop.[106] Additionally, in late 2014, Kohli became a shareholder and brand.</p></div>
